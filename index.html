                <p>
                  In 1798, John Thurman met David Noble and persuaded him to
                  visit his new colony in what is now called Johnsburg. David
                  Noble became a convert to Methodism under the preaching of
                  John Wesley in Ireland. The church was incorporated in 1838
                  and completed in 1843 with its distinctive bell tower.

                  The Wevertown Methodist Episcopal Church was organized on July
                  28, 1879. The first Trustees elected were William Waddell,
                  Phillip Moston and Daniel Loveland. The Church was built in
                  1879 and 1880, celebrating 100 years of service in 1979. The
                  interior featured an elegant chandelier and wooden pews.

                <p>
                  Also known as "Riverside", early residents of this area had to
                  travel to Wevertown, Johnsburg or Chester to attend church.
                  Eventually their needs were recognized and the church was
                  organized by Rev. Leonard A. Bard around 1900, with the
                  building dedicated on March 7, 1912. Today our congregations
                  worship together, maintaining the sacred traditions of our
                  Methodist heritage.

                    This magnificent 10 x 12 foot oil painting graces our
                    sanctuary, created by Rev. Anton Beza during the early days
                    of World War II. The artwork depicts Christ as the Good
                    Shepherd in a pastoral Adirondack setting, perfectly
                    capturing our church's connection to both faith and the
                    natural beauty of our mountain region.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The painting features Christ with His flock against the
                    backdrop of rolling green hills, with the biblical
                    inscription "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills" - a
                    verse that resonates deeply with our congregation surrounded
                    by the Adirondack Mountains.
